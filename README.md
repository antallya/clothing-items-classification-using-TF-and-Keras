## MNIST-Fashion Classification with TensorFlow and Keras
At one of the workshops of the Mexico SIAM (Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics) convention in 2022, I learned how to use TensorFlow API and Keras library in Python to train a sample in MNIST-fashion by Zalando. 

### Dataset content
Some specifics of this dataset are listed as follows:
	There are 60,000 images in the training set, with each image represented by 28×28 bitmaps (matrices)
 There are 60,000 labels for training
 Each label is an integer between 0−9
